# Brien's Weight Loss Tracker

I created this Weight Loss Tracker as a way of keeping track of my weight loss journey. It is intended for my personal use, but anyone is welcome to give it a go. It isn't very complex, but it has helped me to learn Angular. 

## Components included:

-- Weight Loss Tracker: Allows you to enter a date and a current weight.
-- Exercise Tracker: Allows you to select from 4 (currently) different exercises and start a timer. Previous excersises will be displayed and calories burned will be tracked.
-- Calorie Tracker: Allows you to enter a date and daily calories consumed. 

## Technologies Utilized: 

* Angular
* Firebase Authentication
* Cloud Firestore (Database)
* Angular Materials 
* Custom Angular Theme
* NgRx
* Reactive Forms


## Setup:

^^ Clone the repository for week 7 branch (m7)
^^ Run npm install 
^^ Go to localhost:4200 in Chrome
^^ Signup with whatever fake credentials you want.

-- I tried this link from my phone and it appears to be working correctly. 

In Progress:

%% I am currently working on Unit Testing and e2e coverage.
%% I didn't actually use the delete button in my video, but did from my phone and it was not working properly. So that will be my priority fix.
